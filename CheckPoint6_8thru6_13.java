	You hear someone make the following comment: "A blueprint is a design 
	for a house. A carpenter can use the blueprint to build the house. If
	the carpenter wishes, he or she can build several identical houses 
	from the same blueprint." Think of this as a metaphor for classes and 
	objects. Does the blueprint represent a class, or does it represent 
	an object?
	Answer - It represents a class. A class is a blueprint from which 
		multiple objects can be created. 

	6.9
	In this chapter we used the metaphor of a kite attatched to a spool of 
	string to represent the relationship between an object and a reference
	variable. In this metaphor, does the kite represent an object, or a 
	reference variable?
	Answer - It represents an object. The spool of string is the reference 
		variable that leads to and controls what happens to the object. 

	6.10
	When a variable is said to reference an object, what is actually stored
	in the variable?
	Answer - The memory address at the beginning of the objects data is 
		what is stored in the reference variable.

	6.11
	A string literal, such as "Joe", causes what type of object to be 
	created?
	Answer - A string object.

	6.12
	Look at the UML diagram in figure 6-17 and answer the following 
	questions:
	a) What is the name of the class? "Car"
	b) What are the fields? "make" and "yearModel"
	c) What are the methods? "setMake", "setYearModel", "getMake", "getYearModel"
	d) What are the private members? The fields are the private members
	e) What are the public members? The methods are the public members

	6.13
	Assume that "limo" is a variable that references an instance of the 
	class shown in figure 6-17. Write a statement that calls "setMake"
	and passes it the argument "Cadillac".
	
	Car limo = new Car();
	limo.setMake("Cadillac");
